# Brain Tumor Classification

This project implements a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify brain tumor images. The key steps include:

1. **Dataset Loading**: The dataset is loaded directly from Google Drive.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
3. **CNN Model**: A CNN model is built and trained to extract features from the images.
4. **SVM Classifier**: The extracted features are fed into an SVM for classification.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

The notebook walks through each step, from loading the data to training the model and evaluating its performance.
